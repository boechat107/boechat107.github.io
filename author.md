Working as a software engineer for more than 5 years, I have accumulated
experiences ranging from web development to machine learning and computer
vision. I'm a fan of functional programming and open-source projects.

Interests (without a specific order):

* Functional Programming, Machine learning, Web Applications
* Basketball, soccer, weight lifting
* Good books and movies (I'm always open to good suggestions)
* Interesting conversations (my email is at the bottom of the page :-)
* Open-source projects
* Libertarianism

read.
