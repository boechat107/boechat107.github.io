Would you like to understand better yourself (or human beeings in general) to
improve the way you learn? If your answer is "yes", I really recommend the book
[*Pragmatic Thinking and Learning*](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Programmers/dp/1934356050)
by Andy Hunt. Among many interesting stories and exercises, this well written
book describes some recent researches about the way our brain seems to work and
suggests some actions to take advantage of it. Reading the book was really fun!

In this post I would like to highlight some of the book's ideas and how I have
been observing them happening in my experiences.

## A Model of Skill Acquisition

The
[Dreyfus model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition)
of skill acquisition is used as a reference to discuss the journey of becoming an
expert at something. The model includes five stages from *novice* to *expert*:
novices need clear instructions and goals to practice and develop their skills;
experts look for context and awareness.

I'm not an *expert* at skill acquisition, but the model does make sense when I
think about the different colleagues I had at work and how they used to behave
when facing a problem or a task. When proposing a task to a novice, he usually
ask "What should I do?". The experts usually ask many different things about
the context, about the past behavior of something, sometimes even making me
think about the purpose of the question (we can learn from their reasoning).

## Understanding Our Brain

For simplification, the book basically splits the brain into two parts, which it
calls *L-mode* and *R-mode*. The *L-mode* is the part responsible by the logical
thought, analytical analyses and language processing; it seems to be usually
associated to the *consciousness*. The *R-mode* is the *rich* mode, capable of
searching long-term memory and pattern matching, and seems to be associated to
some automatic responses, creativity and intuition.

This model of the brain remembers me of another book:
[*Subliminal*](https://www.amazon.com/Subliminal-Your-Unconscious-Rules-Behavior/dp/0307472256),
by Leonard Mlodinow. The R-mode seems to be the responsible for many of the
automatic reactions we have when we master something or internalize it, it is
the engine that drives us to play with something without *thinking*. The L-mode,
in addition to be responsible for the speech, is the part more familiar to us,
it is the part where our conscious thoughts happen.

### Brain's Bugs

Again, much of the content is very related to *Subliminal*, specially when the
author talks about memory. It seems that the brain usually only store some key
facts about a moment and then, when we try to remember that, it kind of rebuilds
the whole situation. Sometimes the process is almost perfect (specially if we
keep remembering it over and over); sometimes the brain makes huge mistakes. For
me, this phenomenon looks like an image compression algorithm; it makes the
storage and information recovery easier and faster, but "small" errors are
always inserted. Another useful analogy cited in the book is that "every read
is a write".

The memory is just one of the many *bugs* we have, like many different kind of
biases (what is familiar is better; my side is good, your side is bad...).
Although a little counterintuitive, they were crucial from the evolutionary
perspective.

It's always useful to keep the existence of these bugs in mind before engaging
in a serious argumentation.

## Developing a New Skill

There is no magic recipe, only hard work. However, this book is all about
making the learning process more effective and less painful by given us
*awareness*. The feeling of understanding is great, and understanding why the
learning process is the way it is makes feel comfortable also, less anxious.

Here are some key points that I'm trying to keep in mind now when starting to
learn something new:

* play with the matter, ask stupid questions, make mistakes (in a safe
    environment)...
* ... then step back, seat down and review what you have done analytically (what
* usually people call "studying")
* "write drunk, revise sober"
* take notes (oh boy, this is important!), draw pictures, make diagrams
* stablish objectives, **SMART** ones (specific, measurable, achievable,
    relevant, time-boxed)
* try to teach or explain the subject to someone
* imagine how it would be when doing it like a pro (I heard that Michael Phelps
    used to do something similar to improve his movements)
* pay attention to what is happening, awareness is more important than
    memorization
* "pressure kills cognition", the *R-mode* doesn't handle time

## Keeping Focus

I have seen many texts about "focus killers" and how bad they are when regarding
productivity. The book gathers all that info in a single chapter and is great
reference about the subject.

One thing that I always observe on myself is the bad effects of multi-tasking.
If someone keeps a conversation with me while I'm cooking, I always burn
something. And what about an interruption when we are thinking on a recursive
call of a function? We are not good at *context-switching*, it's said that it
kills productivity and I agree with it.

To minimize the effect of unavoidable interruptions, I learned long ago to make
a note exactly about I was just doing before the interruption, like saving the
local variables in a stack. It really helps! It becomes much easier to come back
later and just continue where we were.

Emails, news, IMs are very dangerous when done at the wrong moment. The author
suggests interesting alternatives to relax, like looking at a blank paper
instead of looking for news.
Personally, I prefer to stare at something far from my window or, following
another author's suggestion, I try to meditate for a few minutes.

Another interesting thing that I already had noticed many times is the way some
ideas come when we are stuck into a problem. We spend hours over it, thinking,
trying, and the solution never comes. Then you are tired and need to take leak,
drink a water  or simply starts to complain about the problem to someone else.
Suddenly, like if a light coming directly from the sky, the solution comes clear
to us! It was great to know that this is a serious stuff, that there are even
models about this process.

## Conclusion

*Pragmatic Thinking and Learning* is really a great book and I strongly suggest
it to everyone, specially to software developers (because of the book's
examples). It not only gives us some scientific foundations about human behavior
but also many moments of fun while reading. It made me feel very capable of
learning anything, preparing the mindset to bear the frustrations along the way
and to be aware of common pitfalls.
