Would you like to understand better yourself (or human beeings in general) to
improve the way you learn? If your answer is "yes", I really recommend the book
[*Pragmatic Thinking and Learning*](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Programmers/dp/1934356050)
by Andy Hunt. Among many interesting stories and exercises, this well written
book describes some recent researches about the way our brain seems to work and
suggests some actions to take advantage of it. Reading the book was really fun!

In this post I would like to highlight some of the book's ideas and how I have
been observing them happening in my experiences.

## A Model of Skill Acquisition

The
[Dreyfus model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition)
of skill acquisition is used as a reference to discuss the journey of becoming an
expert at something. The model includes five stages from *novice* to *expert*:
novices need clear instructions and goals to practice and develop their skills;
experts look for context and awareness.

I'm not an *expert* at skill acquisition, but the model does make sense when I
think about the different colleagues I had at work and how they used to behave
when facing a problem or a task. When proposing a task to a novice, he usually
ask "What should I do?". The experts usually ask many different things about
the context, about the past behavior of something, sometimes even making me
think about the purpose of the question (we can learn from their reasoning).

## Understanding Our Brain

For simplification, the book basically splits the brain into two parts, which it
calls *L-mode* and *R-mode*. The *L-mode* is the part responsible by the logical
thought, analytical analyses and language processing; it seems to be usually
associated to the *consciousness*. The *R-mode* is the *rich* mode, capable of
searching long-term memory and pattern matching, and seems to be associated to
some automatic responses, creativity and intuition.

This model of the brain remembers me of another book:
[*Subliminal*](https://www.amazon.com/Subliminal-Your-Unconscious-Rules-Behavior/dp/0307472256),
by Leonard Mlodinow. The R-mode seems to be the responsible for many of the
automatic reactions we have when we master something or internalize it, it is
the engine that drives us to play with something without *thinking*. The L-mode,
in addition to be responsible for the speech, is the part more familiar to us,
it is the part where our conscious thoughts happen.
