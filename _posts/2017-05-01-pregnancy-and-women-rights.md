**Husband:** Darling, I think you should tell your employer that you are
pregnant. You should discuss with him some good arrangements for you both.

**Wife:** Like what?

**Husband:** Like the period of time you would be not working, some partial
availability later, home office hours, etc. And, the most important, you should
tell him that he wouldn't need to pay you while you are not working.

**Wife:** And how would I pay my bills?

**Husband:** I would pay your bills. The baby is ours and I assume the finances
while you can't work.

**Wife:** But I don't want to depend on you like this. I think the employers
should pay the salary while women can't work, there is no other way. I'll be
breast feeding, I can't work for some months, babies are like this. I have the
rights of having a baby.

**Husband:** There is (or was) another way. You could have saved money before,
enough money to leave your job for one year, for example. This is real
independence.

I had this kind of conversation with many different women and the pattern is
clear: *most of people fail to understand the relationship between
rights (or freedom) and responsibility, at least when applied to
pregnancy.*

Freedom and responsibility are tightly coupled. You can't never be really free
if you can't assume the responsibility on your actions.

Put yourself in the position of an employer or talk to a friend who owns a
company and try to understand why usually women have more difficulties to find
good jobs and receive higher salaries than men. I don't want to simplify a
complex relationship such as employer and employee, but it's clear to me that
women usually *have and ask* for more **rights** than men.

Is it really fair when a woman has the freedom to choose when she gets pregnant
(yes, she has in the 99% of the cases) while the employer is just forced to
absorb many of the consequences? Please, put yourself in the employer position
before answering.

Let's think about an example. Imagine you pay monthly a gym instructor and
you're so far very happy about her service. Then, one day she suddenly tells you
she is pregnant and she won't work for the next four months, but she expects you
to continue to pay normally over this period. Does it sound *insane*?

If you think deeply you are going to see that the real employer/employee
relationship is practically the same of the wife I mentioned before. The wife,
as an employee, sell her services to her company in a very similar way a gym
instructor sells her service to anyone else.

*Personal principles are usually not related to legal rights; they very often
oppose each other.* The former says much about a *character*; the other depends
*where* you live. Do your principles change when you move to another country?

Yes, I'm a man talking about pregnancy. Why should any woman listen to me?
Because getting pregnant (even accidentally) or becoming a father is a
**decision** you make at some point, starting when you have sex with someone. If
you want to be free to make this kind of decisions, you should be prepared to
assume the responsibilities.
